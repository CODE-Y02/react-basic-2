# Context API

### What is the problem we are trying to solve here?

- whenever we need to pass data between adjecent component , data must flow through common parent between them
- In react data is only transfered between parent and clild (using states)
- Now when our application is large there may be some components in which we are passing props but not using them
- those component just acts like data carrear for those props (un utilized)
- This leads to pronlem of prop drilling and increase reduncay in code

---

### What is prop chain and what is the problem that it has?

- lets say we have component structure like

        ABC(parent) -> A(clild) -> a1 (grandclild) ;
        ABC(parent) -> B(clild) -> b1 (grandclild) ;
        ABC(parent) -> C(clild) -> c1 (grandclild) ;

- now we want to pass data from c1 to a1 it will go like this

        c1 -> C ->ACB -> A -> a1

- now here C , ABC and A are not utilizing data (especillly C and A ) they just acts like bridge
- THIS is Propchain and in huge application this is problem
- it exposes data to some component where its not needed
- It leads to code reduncy

### How do we plan to solve it?

- We can use global state management to solve this
- React has Context ApI in it
- with it we can pass state from and to any Component without having prop chain

### Please write down the steps involved to add the Login context

- create context file ( src/store/auth-context.js)
- use reacts createcontext that takes initial or default value of state

        const AuthContext = createContext({
                                isLoggedIn: false,
                            });

- we will export this AuthContext
- wrap component where we want to have this auth state acccess

        <AuthContext.Provider>
                // component which needs access to state in our case its App
        < / AuthContext.Provider>

### How do we consume the context API

- we can use it using consumer
- wrap component were we need to use it with AuthContext.consumer
- inside it we will have fuction that has context and return jsx

### What do you think about context API. When would you use it

- whenever we need to pass state between adjecent components

### What are the steps to convert to context api hook? Why do we need this steps any idea

- instead of using AuthContext.consumer we can use useContext hook
- it takes context obj and returns context value
- we can assign this value to variable and use it

             const context = useContext(AuthContext);

            we can use it like
            context.isLoggedIn

- because less code

> NOTE when we set initial context state in provider ve can also set function
