# Context API

### What is the problem we are trying to solve here?

- whenever we need to pass data between adjecent component , data must flow through common parent between them
- In react data is only transfered between parent and clild (using states)
- Now when our application is large there may be some components in which we are passing props but not using them
- those component just acts like data carrear for those props (un utilized)
- This leads to pronlem of prop drilling and increase reduncay in code

### What is prop chain and what is the problem that it has?

- lets say we have component structure like

        ABC(parent) -> A(clild) -> a1 (grandclild) ;
        ABC(parent) -> B(clild) -> b1 (grandclild) ;
        ABC(parent) -> C(clild) -> c1 (grandclild) ;

- now we want to pass data from c1 to a1 it will go like this

        c1 -> C ->ACB -> A -> a1

- now here C , ABC and A are not utilizing data (especillly C and A ) they just acts like bridge
- THIS is Propchain and in huge application this is problem
- it exposes data to some component where its not needed
- It leads to code reduncy

### How do we plan to solve it?

- We can use global state management to solve this
- React has Context ApI in it
- with it we can pass state from and to any Component without having prop chain
